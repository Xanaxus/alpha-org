#+TITLE: alpha-org

=alpha-org= is a powerful configuration for =org-mode=, similar to how [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] are configurations for Emacs as a whole.

* Installation

The easiest way to install the whole thing is with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]], which may be installed from [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].  Evaluate this code:

#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
  (quelpa '(alpha-org :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/alpha-org"))
#+end_src

* Requirements

These packages must already be installed:

* Code
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:elisp: :tangle alpha-org.el
:END:

** Header

This header is tangled to =alpha-org.el=, declaring package dependencies so that they can be installed automatically.

*** TODO Appearance / UI [0/2]


**** TODO =org-sidebar=
**** TODO =yequake=

 The ~yequake-org-capture~ function is used to provide a quick capturing UI with drop-down Emacs windows that disappear automatically when a capture is finalized or canceled.

**** [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets][=org-bullets=]]

  This mode replaces heading stars with visually appealing ones.  Its settings can be customized in the =org-bullets= group.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (use-package org-bullets
      :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))
  #+END_SRC

***** TODO Screenshot
**** [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header][=org-sticky-header=]]

This package displays in the header-line the Org heading for the node that’s at the top of the window. This way, if the heading for the text at the top of the window is beyond the top of the window, you don’t forget which heading the text belongs to. The display can be customized to show just the heading, the full outline path, or the full outline path in reverse.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-sticky-header
    :hook (org-mode . org-sticky-header-mode))
#+END_SRC
***** TODO Screenshot
*** Miscellaneous

**** [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc][=org-make-toc=]]

This package automates customizeable tables of contents in Org files.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-make-toc
    :hook (org-mode . org-make-toc-mode))
#+END_SRC
